I'm Bill Thompson. I'm a full-stack web developer, father and husband (not in order).

I work at Bigcommerce in Austin, TX on a small team focused on enabling the business. My responsibilities change daily and I have had the opportunity to work across a large range of systems. Most often I work in PHP, HTML, CSS and JS. Additionally, I have worked on projects using Sinatra, Rails 4 and NodeJS.
